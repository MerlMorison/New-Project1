  and search pools
Additions:

### Version 1.03 - editor script updates, custom urls support separately for both android and pc
Due to and issue in android builds of vrchat (https://feedback.vrchat.com/udon/p/vrcurlinputfield-incorrect-focus-issue-on-quest)
made support for custom, shorter urls that are nicer to use on android
(can be set inside of internal settings, only do if you know what you are doing)

Fixes:
- fixed weird rendering of the bottom of the scroll view due to using compressed sprite as a mask for it
Changes:
- reworked assigning default url logic, automated android detection
- links in the into tab are now clickable
- better distinguishing between adroid-specific and pc-specific logic
Additions:
- added option to force search to think its on adroid when its on pc, mostly for debugging


### Version 1.04 - IwaSync3 support and bug fix

Fixes:
- Reverted to loading logic from 1.02 due to error that made it load infinitely in some cases
- Small UI Fixes
Changes: 
- Removed separate URLs for Android (from 1.03) because vrchat will fix the issue it was made to fix in the next update
Additions:
- IwaSync3 Support
- IwaSync3 Styled prefab


### Version 1.05 - Queue plugins, video titles and arbitrary videoplayers support

Fixes: 
- Adjusted some ui collision boxes being wrong size

Changes:
- Changed default pre-filled url message to simpler "Type search here â†’" (can be changed in internals if needed)
- Renamed InputField into YTSearchPrefab_URLInputField to make it easier to tell it apart from other input fields
- Restructured Results template to enable more diverse on-hover animations
- Improved Editor HelpBox messages to include clear instructions on what to do rather than just error statements
- Improved UI feedback:
  - Hovering over the preview will both darken the preview and display available interaction options (Play / Queue)
  with buttons on-hover animation being separated too
- Substatially improved Error handling - now if you have setup something incorrectly you will see an error in game 
  instead of things just breaking / undefined behaviour / infinite loading
  yay no more infinite loading
- Removed option to render results in compact view wihthout images because nobody used it and it was a potential
  point of failure
- Simplified some other logic to get rid of other potential points of failure

Additions:
- Added support for Queue plugins:
  - Now you can specify VRCUrlInputField to use when adding video to the Queue
  - Now you can specify InputField for the name of the video, so Queue displays its name instead of URLs
  - You can choose if you want to keep both Play and Queue buttons or use only Queue (useful for players 
  like ProTV where they use the same input logic so buttons do the same thing anyway)
- Added ability to display name of the video instead of URL on videoplayer that support it (have InputField
  for it)
- Aded support for any videoplayers using VRCUrlInputField with custom events for entering URL, so now you
  can connect it to practically any videoplayer in the game
- Prefab version is not printed in the debug output upon its initialization



### Version 1.1 - !IMPORTANT fix for preview processing logic
If you have preview displaying issues - update to this one!

Additions:
- Added ability to load playlists by putting either playlist link or link to a video from playlist into search 

Fixes:
- Fixed bug making previews look weird (previews can be any size now)
- Fixed Search Field overflowing if the request was very loading
- Fixed name of the InputField on IwaSync3 variant 



### Version 1.11 - Major pool generation optimization and support for more videoplayers:

Additions:
- Native YAMA player support (Requested by TORI)
- Native VizVid player support (Requested by Rosefall)
- Added setting that forces search to preoretize latest videos in the results (on by default)

Changes: 
- Pool generation now runs as a post-process, significantly speeding up build times, especially
  for big pools of URLs (before it required up to 7min to build world with 30_000 urls in the pool,
  now its practically instant)
- Improved error handling in cases where image is not provided or can't be loaded
- Clarified License agreement making it significantly easier to understand

Fixes:
- Fixed case where if the SearchManager is left disabled at start - first search doesn't result in
  errors for those cases anymore



### Version 1.12 - New UI Styles and minor Fixes

Additions:
- Prefab version with big images:3
  - big images default style
  - big images transparent style
  - big images IwaSync style

Fixes:
- Fixed VizVid native support, now it sends both events needed to play the video sequentially
- Fixed wrong offset of hover overlay on the video images
- Fixed bug that made preoretizing latest not apply correctly decreasing general quality of the search results

Changes:
- Changed internal structure of the result template to make it possible to adjust to the title size
- Changed folder structure of prefabs a bit to make it easier to find version you need
- Changed UI stuff to allow for easier resizing if needed (still pretty bothersome, ngl)
